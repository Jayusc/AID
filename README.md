# Athlete In-depth

## Summary and Description

### Best postgame reviews of the player

## Proposed Architecture

Our project is divided into three phases. In the first phase itâ€™s a web-application, a front-end webpage working with a Node.js backend pulling game stats everyday, users can comment and rate on the webpage or querying our GraphQL API. Game stats and user comments are stored and managed by through mangoDB.
